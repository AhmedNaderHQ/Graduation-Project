## 🎓 Graduation Project Portfolio – ADAS & V2V

Welcome to the official interactive portfolio of our graduation project:
**Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) with Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) Communication.**

This platform is not just a website—it's a comprehensive, visual, and technical walkthrough of our entire project. It brings together all tracks we worked on, including Web Development, Embedded Systems, Artificial Intelligence, UI/UX Design, Firebase Integration, Real-Time Monitoring, and more.

### 🎯 Why This Portfolio?
This portfolio was built to serve as:

- **🧾 A complete documentation** of the system's components, functionality, and logic
- **💻 A live demo** of how the ADAS and V2V features work in real time
- **🎯 A presentation layer** that simplifies the explanation of each technical module
- **🤝 A proof of our teamwork** and how different tracks collaborated toward one vision
- **🌐 A modern, responsive platform** that blends technical accuracy with clean design

### 🔹 Project Overview
A clear introduction to the idea, system goals, and the real-world problem we are solving with ADAS + V2V.

### 🔹 System Tracks Covered
We dedicated a section to each major track in the project:

- **Web Development:** Frontend design & interaction (HTML/CSS/JS) + Firebase integration
- **Embedded Systems:** Sensor-based features (EEBL, LDW, BSW…) implemented and triggered from hardware
- **Artificial Intelligence:** Face recognition & driver monitoring with Firebase alerts

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Team Collaboration
This project reflects strong coordination between different team members working on multiple tracks. The website was built to tie everything together—from reading sensor values, to recognizing faces, to displaying alerts and controlling feature states.

### 🌟 Final Notes
We wanted this portfolio to:

- Be a **single source of truth** for the whole project
- Explain the **logic and flow** behind every module
- Represent our **effort, knowledge, and teamwork**
- Make it easy for anyone—technical or non-technical—to understand what we built

**Thank you for visiting our portfolio. We hope it inspires and educates anyone interested in ADAS systems and full-stack integration!**
